### simple binary classification task
## quick start
Dont change anything, run py in order:<br>
1:get_datasets.py<br>
If generate mode is 0: <br>
While running, you will need to draw 2 curves to generate points inside them, <br>
if you dont know how to draw, just draw 2 disjoint circles <br>

2:train.py<br>

3:show_result.py<br>


## for further user:
Try to change params.py, understand each param in params.py
